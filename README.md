# ezcanvas
Simple wrapper around some Golang "image" functions, for drawing simple shapes, or just setting individual pixels. Transparency has been removed for simplicity's sake.

Example programmes are at https://github.com/fohristiwhirl/ezcanvas_examples

### Acknowledgements

Some of the algorithms used (for circles and lines) are things I read 15 years ago on webpages that no longer exist. That's about all my records from that era indicate.
